Highlight Trailing Whitespace 2.0.0 changes:

  - Changed to use a package-specific settings file
    - You'll need to migrate your old settings to the new format to apply them, sorry about this
  - Added refreshing of all views when any setting is changed
  - Added default settings with in-line documentation of each setting
  - Added shorthands for the settings (try looking for it with the command palette!)
